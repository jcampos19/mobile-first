        <p><img src="../images/rockhopper.jpg" alt="penguin_family" class="floated"><div class="clearIt"></div>The evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography; though as penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been published since 2005, the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.</p>
		<p>The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that, by the end of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically</p>
    	<p>it is fairly likely that they were not yet entirely flightless at that time, as flightless birds have generally low resilience to the breakdown of trophic webs that follows the initial phase of mass extinctions because of their below-average dispersal capabilities</p>

        		<li>Larger penguin species are found in colder climates where their large body mass enables them to cope with the conditions, while smaller penguins inhabit warmer climes.</li>
    			<li>Penguins are flightless birds.</li>
        		<li>While other birds have wings for flying, penguins have adapted flippers to help them swim in the water.</li>
				<li>The Galapagos Penguin is the only penguin specie that ventures north of the equator in the wild.</li>
        		<li>No penguins live at the North Pole.</li>
        		<li>Penguins can drink sea water.</li>
        		<li>Penguins spend around half their time in water and the other half on land.</li>
        		<li>Emperor Penguins can stay underwater for around 20 minutes at a time.</li>
        		<li>Penguins in Antarctica have no land based predators.</li>
